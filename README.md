## Prerequisites
- **AutoHotkey**: The script requires AutoHotkey to run. You can download it from [AutoHotkey Official Site](https://www.autohotkey.com/).

## Installation Instructions
1. Download and install AutoHotkey.
2. Save the script as `MenuX.X.X.exe` (this is required for the script to function correctly).
3. Double-click the `MenuX.X.X.exe` to start the script.
4. The `X.X.X` depends on the version of which you downloaded. Basically keep the name the same.

## Script Usage
### Hotkeys:
- **Script Toggle** (`Home`): Show or hide the main menu.
- **Enable/Disable Script** (`\`): Toggle the main functionality of the script. If enabled, the script will actively control the mouse and perform functions like triggerbot and recoil control.

- **Enable/Disable FOV** (`0`): Toggle the display of the field of view (FOV) window.

### Menu Settings
The script provides a user-friendly interface with two main pages:

1. **Page 1 (Main Settings)**: Allows you to adjust the Dot Color, FOV width, FOV height, Recoil Control, Default Offset, and Lock-On Strength.
2. **Page 2 (Toggle Settings)**: Includes options to toggle FOV Display, Triggerbot, Zombies Mode, Dropshot Mode, Shotgun Mode, and Multiplayer Mode.

### Features Explained:
- **Dot Color (Hex)**: Specify the color of the target dot in hexadecimal format (e.g., 0xDF00FF for purple).
- **FOV Width/Height**: Define the scanning area for the dot detection.
- **Recoil Control**: Use a value between 0.0 and 1.0 to control how much recoil is compensated.
- **Lock-On Strength**: Adjust the strength of the scriptâ€™s auto-lock-on functionality.
- **Zombies Mode**: Automatically adjusts the offset for zombie-themed gameplay, positioning the crosshairs differently.
- **Dropshot Mode**: When enabled, the script automatically drops the character to the ground by pressing the "C" key when the right mouse button (RMB) or LT (Axis Z) is pressed.
- **Shotgun Mode**: Automatically fires repeatedly when activated (suitable for shotgun play).
- **Triggerbot**: Automatically shoots when an enemy is detected under the targeting dot.

## Controller Support

- **Controller Support**: The script supports controller input for specific features, including:
  - **Triggerbot**: Works with controllers for automatic shooting when the target is aligned.
  - **Dropshot Mode**: Automatically drops the character when the right trigger (or equivalent button) is pressed.
  - **Shotgun Mode**: Automatically fires repeatedly when activated, ideal for controller users.

Currently, we're working on updates for the **Aim Lock** feature, and any new updates will be posted in the [Discord Server](https://dsc.gg/143x) before being made available on the GitHub page. Some features may not work as expected.


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues or the script isn't functioning as expected:

- Ensure the script is named `Menu3.0.0.exe`. If it isn't, rename it to match the required filename.
- Double-check that AutoHotkey is installed and correctly configured on your system.
- Ensure that your game settings are configured properly to allow the script to interact with the screen and detect pixels.
- Ensure you enable FOV in the menu settings or this will cause mouse movements to spaz out.
- Ensure you're on 1920x1080p resolution, desktop and game. (May work on other resolutions).
- Ensure Enemy Names in the options are set to Icon Only.
- Ensure Enemy Colour in game is set to #DF00FF.
